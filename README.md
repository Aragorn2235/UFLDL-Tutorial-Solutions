UFLDL-Tutorial-Solutions
========================

My Matlab code solutions to the famous UFLDL Tutorial. It includes all the proposed exercises from these two lists:
-http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial
-http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial



Additional solutions:
-I have additionally included in the file "orthonormalICACost.m" of the exercise "Independent component analysis", the
cost and gradient of the same problem stated as a RICA (Reconstruction ICA) if you want to make comparations. 

Notes:
-The solution of the exercise "Sparse coding" gets to learn the features, but in a longer number of iterations. Furthermore,
I changed the "alpha" parameter, for it to converge faster. There seems to be a bug in the exercise setting, because
solutions tend to be not very sparse, so please, feel free to discuss or contact me if you have a better working
solution.
